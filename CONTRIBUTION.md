# Contributing to Python MySQL API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our MySQL API for Python! We believe in creating a learning space for everyone and are excited for you to join us in making this small project impactful during this semester. Let's grow and learn together!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later is required.
- We use `unittest` for testing.
- The main dependency is `mysql-connector-python`, so ensure you have it installed:
  ```bash
  pip install mysql-connector-python
  ```

### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Boaz-Maroko/pythonmysqlapi.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pythonmysqlapi
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run tests to ensure everything is set up properly:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

### Code Guidelines

- The functionality should be expressed primarily using **classes**. Functions are allowed, but only when necessary and appropriate.
- Ensure all code follows [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines. Use a linter to check before submitting.
- Each new feature or change should be accompanied by a corresponding test within the `unittest` framework.

### Branching and Commit Messages

#### Branch structure:
- **Feature branch**: Development starts in the features branch, where new ideas are first implemented.
- **Development branch**: Once a feature or idea is stable and functional in the feature branch, it is moved to the development branch, where it is refined and ironed out.
- **Main branch**: The main branch is reserved for production-ready code only.

- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names for your branches:
   ```markdown
   feature/add-new-endpoint
   fix/correct-sql-bug
   ```
- **Commit messages**: Use the following format:
   ```markdown
   [type]: [subject]
   
   Example:
   feat: add user authentication
   fix: correct SQL query on User model
   ```

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest
   ```
4. Open a pull request and describe your changes.

Thank you for contributing!
