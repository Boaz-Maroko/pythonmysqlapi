# Python MySQL API

Welcome to the **Python MySQL API**! ðŸš€ This project provides a simple, class-based approach to interacting with MySQL databases using Python. Whether you're just starting out or have experience, our goal is to create a space for learning and contributing to building an API that will be used throughout the semester.

With Python 3.10+ at its core and leveraging `unittest` for robust testing, this API allows you to efficiently manage MySQL connections and queries, all within a modular, easy-to-understand framework. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

### Key Features
- **Class-Based Architecture**: Functionality is structured using Python classes for scalability and clean code organization.
- **MySQL Connector**: Utilize the `mysql-connector-python` library for seamless database interactions.
- **Testing**: All major components are covered by unit tests using Pythonâ€™s `unittest` framework to ensure everything runs smoothly.

### Let's Build Together
Join us in this exciting journey. Whether you're here to learn or contribute, we hope this project provides valuable insights and hands-on experience. Let's make something amazing by the end of this semester!
